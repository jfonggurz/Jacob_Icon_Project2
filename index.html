    <div>
        <p> There are over 762,000 New Yorkers who cycle on a frequent basis, as found by the Community Health Survey from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Health (NYC DOH) and listed on the New York City Department of Transportation (NYC DOT) <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/bicyclists/bikestats.shtml#:~:text=28%25%20of%20adult%20New%20Yorkers,Yorkers%20ride%20a%20bike%20regularly" target="blank"> website</a>. The NYC DOH also said on its <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/bicycling-in-new-york-city.page" target="blank"> website</a> that cycling allows people to get needed exercise and lists specific ways the activity can help people’s health, one of which is preventing diabetes. </p>

        <p> With the many cyclers in New York City and the recommendation to do this activity, New Yorkers need a comprehensive guide to help them. There is a lot of information and resources for cyclers, but this guide will provide you with one place to access useful and interesting information. </p>
